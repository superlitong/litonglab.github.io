excerpt: 'Although the wireless network is widely used in many fields, its characteristics such as high bit error rate and broadcast links may block its development. Network coding is an artistic way to exploit its intrinsic characteristics to increase the network reliability. Some people research network coding schemes for inter-flow or intra-flow, each type with its own advantages and disadvantages. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism, called MM-NCOPE, which integrates the idea of interflow and intra-flow coding. On one hand, MM-NCOPE utilizes random liner coding to encode the NCOPE packets while NCOPE is a sub-protocol for optimizing the COPE algorithm by iteration. In NCOPE, packets are automatically matched by size to be coded. As a result, it improves the coding gain in some level. On the other hand, we adopt the partial Acknowledgement retransmission scheme to achieve high compactness and robustness. ACK is an independent packet with the highest priority rather than a part of the data packets. Compared with existing works on opportunistic network coding, our approach ensures the reliability of wireless links and improves the coding gain.'
